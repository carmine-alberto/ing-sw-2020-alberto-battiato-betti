# Prova Finale di Ingegneria del Software a.a. 2019-2020
During this year final exam the partecipants were required to implement the game [Santorini](http://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/santorini/) using Java programming language and in particular Model View Controller pattern. The project covers all the game's rules for two and three players with the exceptions of severals advanced gods. Using object-oriented programming two different game modes were developed: CLI and GUI. CLI mode (Command Line Interface) offers a simple game mode to be used in the command line. For those who would like a more complete and good-looking game experience, there is the GUI (Graphical User Interface).

## UML
The UML documentation is avialable in two different versions, the initial one, created as soon as the problem was brought us, and the final one: created once completed the program. There are several and interesting differences.

* [Initial UML](/http://linkUMLiniziale.com)

* [Final UML](/http://linkUMLfinale.com)

## JavaDoc
The project is also provided with a Java documentation (JUnit 5) that covers almost every model's class.

## JAR Execution
For both client and server jars is required [Java 14.0.1 JDK](https://jdk.java.net/14/) version.
The jars can be found in the deliverables folder of the project.

### Server
You can launch the server with the command <code> java --enable-preview -jar .\AM49-Server.jar </code>
  
### Client
Once found the client jar, the it will be enough to type  <code> java --enable-preview -jar .\AM49-Client.jar </code>
- CLI 
In order to use this game mode it will be necessary to insert the parameter <code>-CLI</code> when launching the jar file
- GUI
To play in GUI game mode, there are no other parameters to add

It will anyways be possible to switch from one mode to another in some moments during the program's excution. For example during a CLI game by typing switch, or in a GUI game by selecting CLI during the login.
